# DogFed
App designed for Hack The Northeast - 2021

Category: Inconvienet App

Function:
- iOS app developed to remind the user if they have already fed the dog for their current meal.
  - Screen is red with "NO" displayed right in the middle to inform the user that the dog had not been fed for the time period.
  - Screen is green with "YES" displayed if the dog had already been fed for that meal period.
  - Clicking the screen changes the screen to mark the meal as complete - pop up with a message when switching to "YES"
 
 Ideas for functionality:
 - Settings feature to input the number of meals the dog gets per day
  - Time periods of when the meal would be served
    - Asks if supplements/medicine was given for this meal
      - Perhaps a toggle in the settings if you wish for this prompt?
    - Ability to notify user if the dog has missed a meal within the designated time periold
    - Ability to reset for the next meal while notifying the user that the dog has not had their current meal
      - Would require a variable (perhaps an optional) in order to this as it would take up memory to have the variable sitting.
 - Designating name of Dog that is missing meal (Multiple Dog Compatibility)
 - Ability to share dog profile with multiple devices so household can mark the meal complete
   - Name of household member that fed the dog
   - Instead of directly asking the person, why not do it through the app? Less talking to people!
